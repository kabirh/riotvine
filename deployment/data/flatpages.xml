We love going to shows. They're the perfect opportunity to promote your campaign and accept contributions, so we made it easy.

Campaigns tickets allow your fans to quickly contribute to your campaigns. In exchange for their contribution, they receive a ticket that directs them to IlliusRock.com. Each ticket has a unique code on it that acknowledges them as a contributor to your campaign.

### I don't get it?

Here's a handy 3 step breakdown:

1. Request campaign tickets.
2. Accept contributions.
3. Hand out a campaign ticket for each contribution.

### What if the fan is not a registered on Illius Rock? Can they still contribute?

Yes, they'll be asked to create an account after they enter their unique code on our website.

### Why is there a maximum on the amount of tickets I can request?

Your campaigns have a limited number of spots, so the maximum number of tickets you can request is limited to the maximum number of spots available in your campaign.

### How many campaign tickets should I request?

That's up to you, but we'd recommend enough to meet demand at live shows but still leave some left over for fans that want to contribute online.

### If I request the maximum number of tickets, what happens to my campaign?

The number of tickets you request will be automatically deducted from the total available campaign spots. This ensures that everyone that receives a ticket will have an open spot in your campaign. Unfortunately, anyone that goes to your campaign page will be told that online contributions are unavailable, and will be directed to contact you.

### I requested campaign tickets; what next?

You should receive campaign tickets 5-7 days after they are requested. They are mailed to the band address we have on file for you. Once received, you can immediately start accepting contributions in exchange for tickets.

We love going to live shows, and think they're a great venue for
artists to show you why you should contribute to their campaigns. If
an artist has an ongoing campaign on IlliusRock.com, they can accept
your contributions at their live shows. In exchange for your
contribution, you'll receive a campaign ticket with a unique code that
you can enter above. Once entered, it will acknowledge your contribution to the 
artist's campaign and qualify you for the campaign offering.

{@class=button} [Create an Artist Account](/artist/register/?next=/artist/)

### Create a campaign

Campaigns let you engage your fans, promote yourself and raise money for interesting projects. 

Answer these questions:
- What are you trying to raise money for?
- What can you offer your fans for their contributions?

#### Examples:
Got an awesome idea for a music video but don't have the cast, crew or money to make it happen? Share your idea with yours fans, let them contribute to the concept and take part in the video.

Need to raise money to record a new album?  You can use Illius Rock to attract contributions, and offer your fans:

* advance  or signed copies of the album
* private, listening parties
* invitations to the recording sessions, or to the album release party
* shout outs in the album liner notes

Campaigns can be free! You decide how much fans can contribute to your campaign. The only fees are based on a small percentage of the money you raise in your campaign.

### Raise Money

Once your campaign is approved, you'll be able to accept fan contributions directly. This money goes directly into your Paypal or Google Checkout account and can be transferred to a regular bank account for free.

### Engage

Illius Rock aims to bring you together with your fans. Use your contributions to fund new projects, like expanded tours, new equipment, music videos and give your fans exclusive access. Stay in touch with these fans whenever you launch a campaign.

### Communicate

Fans that contribute to a campaign can be notified of new campaigns.
