Hey Rajesh,
Here's the email that artists should receive when they get a campaign contribution:
Subject: Whoa! Someone just joined your campaign!
Hey there,
It looks like someone supports your work. Head to your campaign to find out who your newest supporter is: %LINK%


So far, I've found two embeddable players: http://reverbnation.com and http://www.projectopus.com/players
Let me know if it's easier for me to just send you example embed code from these in order to add them. 


Also, I thought of an additional feature I'd like, batch photo uploads. Let me know how much this feature will run.


Was there anything else you were waiting on from me, besides a mockup of the registration process? I'm still trying to figure out the "Newest Contributors" section.


Thanks,
Kabir
