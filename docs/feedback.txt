> Artist Registration:	Move paypal e-mail address field to a new page.	I want to create a wizard out of this as well, with info about paypal registration, rates, etc. available on a single page:	Medium Priority.

--------------------------------------------------------

> Campaign Page:	When the max number of campaign tickets have been requested but not all have been redeemed, can you display a message on this page that says, "Sorry, online contribution for this campaign is no longer available. Don't lose heart! You might still be able to contribute to this campaign at a live show." Medium

---------------------------

> Campaign Page	Is there a message displayed when a campaign is sold out?

No. But I will add it. I assume that "sold out" means online contributions have been filled up as well as all tickets redeemed. Is that correct?

Sorry, there are no available spots open in this campaign


=======================

Campaign Preview Page:
	"Your campaign Music video! has been created. Once you have previewed it, please submit it for approval." Please change this to: This is what your campaign page will look like. If you are happy with it, please submit it for approval. 
	
	It looks like the embed code works before a campaign is approved. It might make sense to move the embed code to a different screen and remove it from the campaign preview. They should only see this code after the campaign is approved. I suspect this will take some time but it's a low priority.
	
Campaign Badge:

	Please add the artist name to the top left corner of the badge, above the campaign title. Medium priority. 
	
	On the embeddable badge, add "CLICK TO CONTRIBUTE" text to the top right corner. I think one of Emil's mockups had something like this, with white text on a green background and I liked the look of that. Medium priority.

Registration:

	Our EULA caps the age for users to 13 and older. I'm not sure the best way to handle this, but can you redirect users that are too young to a page that just says, "We're sorry. Based on the information you have submitted to us, you are ineligible to register on IlliusRock.com." Low priority. 

==========================

Main page:

Instead of "Register donation", use "Redeem Campaign Ticket". Please make this font the same throughout. When people see "Register", they think of account registration. 
Change "ARTISTS AREA" to "Artist Login/Registration".
Remove "Start a campaign". We can replace this with "View more Campaigns"

Create Artist Account Page:

Change Username to Login name, and add this text underneath:

Add to the top of this page: "All personal information provided will not be published by Illius Rock."


After registration page:

It says "account has been updated" Can you remove that text?
Remove "Convert your account to an artist account"

Create Campaign:

I think there is an issue with the image upload function. I don't think we discussed a file size limitation for campaign badge images, but the images I've tried to upload sometimes hang. Is there a quick image upload applet that you can add, so that a

Change Title to Campaign Title. Add character limit and "e.g. Music Video, New Instruments, etc"

Instead of Maximum contributions, "Maximum number of contributors"
Instead of Max contributions per person, Maximum number of allowed contributions per person
