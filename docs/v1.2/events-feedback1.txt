> Is it possible to get rid of that thin, white border around the badge?

Yes. The reason for that was that when embedded on a dark page on an
external site, the badges may not have enough separation. But, no
problem removing the border.

Will do.

Great idea! Yes, it's perfectly doable. Would we limit them to one row
of 3 badges or 2 rows totalling 6 badges?

OK. I think that's doable too. Basically, here's how that might work:
Each of the badge slots will pull in one of the recent approved
campaign or event badges randomly. That might mean that sometimes it
will be all 3 event badges and other times all 3 campaign badges. But
most times they will be a mix. Because there will be more events than
campaign at most times, you should generally get 2 events and 1
campaign out of 3.

Sounds good. I will add that in.

Sure.

Great. Make sense and is trivial to change that.

Yes. This was already something I was going to fix but thanks for
catching it anyway :)

Yes. Makes sense. I will try to add that in. The widget defaults to
only the times you see. I will check if I can add 9pm there.

How about removing the end time and asking them for the duration of
the concert in hours and minutes? We can then internally calculate the
end time and roll it over to the next day if necessary. Would that be
more intuitive/less confusing to enter?

> Will the Events also have SEO URLs?

Yes. As soon as I do the SEO URLs for the campaigns (already a
priority 1 item), the events will get the same feature.
