XXX - Additionally, can you make the "Add your own pictures to this show!" text on the event page a larger font size? I want to make sure it's noticeable.

XXX - In the Fan Profile, instead of using the artist image to show the campaigns you've contributed to, can you display the campaign badge? This is super low priority.

XXX - On the event page, can you move the "Listen to this artist:" text so that it is flush against the embedded player?

XXX - The picture added notification is a little off:
	The bright orange text with yellow links in it is too loud. Was there a lot of work involved to get it placed in the top right near the messages box? I'd prefer if the text were white and the links were yellow.

So, if I type in "Sultans of swing", the message will just say:

from http://illiusrock.com: Sultans of swing

and not:

from http://illiusrock.com: listening to "Sultans of swing"

Is that OK?

That's a neat idea.

Yes, that does make sense to add now. I will assume you want to go ahead with this (it's no more than 1 hour to add this). Let me know if to hold off.
