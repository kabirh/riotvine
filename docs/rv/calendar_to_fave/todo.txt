DONE: 12/19/2009 Release
-------------------------------------------------------
* Let's change the "Who's on board?" text on the left to "Favorite'd by:"

* Add "How RiotVine Works" to the link bar at the bottom. Point it to the flatpage for this: /flat/how-it-works/

* Update AJAX login popup to include EULA text

* Bring up the unified popup straight from the landing page

* I just noticed the main signup form from the landing page still uses the old AJAX popup. We should try to 
combine that AJAX popup with the new one, so that users that choose twitter don't receive two popups. I think it's 
okay to get rid of the old Twitter AJAX popup. When we launched it, oauth wasn't nearly as prevalent and now it's 
everywhere so users are getting used to it.

* On the new AJAX sign-in, we should switch the panels around so Twitter and Facebook are on the left, and 
include text above them saying,

	  Header: Sign in with your Twitter or Facebook account
      Gray subtext: Don't worry, we NEVER update your status behind your back.

* Rename Ripe Picks accordingly to Friends' Favorites. If that's too long for any field, Friends' Favs works. 

* Add the star for anonymous users and then just prompt them to sign up via the new unified AJAX popup 
as soon as they click it.

* Add to Favorites: * Comments: o Share: RT FB

* Make the comment bubble a clickable link that scrolls down to the tweets. If you can do this for the 
city pages as well as the event pages, that would be perfect.

* Add the green sign-up button and text from the landing page to the city page. This should look like it 
does on the event pages.
