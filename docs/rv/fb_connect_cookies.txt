APIKEY_user
    The user ID of the currently logged in user. 
APIKEY_session_key
    The current session. This is used to make API requests. 
APIKEY_expires
    When the current session expires. This is usually an hour or two after it's granted. If it's 0, then it means the session does not expire. 
APIKEY_ss
    The session secret. This prevents someone who knows your session key from using the session. 
APIKEY (with nothing after it)
    The signature (created using the application secret), which will be generated from all of the other parameters. 
    
 To generate the signature for these arguments:

   1. Remove the "fb_sig_" prefix from all of the keys.
   2. Sort the array alphabetically by key.
   3. Concatenate all key/value pairs together in the format "k=v" (omitting the signature itself, since that is what we are calculating).
   4. Append your secret key, which you can find by going to the Developers application and following the link for your application.
   5. Take the md5 hash of the whole string.
