Single sign-on users should be able to:

* tweet from event pages
* get ripe picks
* show up in the On Board section with other interested users

For this last bullet, I'm not sure the best way to structure this flow. I'm picturing 
different things to direct users on what to do:


Before SSO:
================
* Text that explains what SSO provides and directs them to click an "Interested" button
* An "Interested" button, when clicked produces an AJAX popup to explain SSO, similar to our registration.
* The empty My Calendar prompt remains the same


After SSO:
================
* Remove text that explains what SSO provides
* Leave Interested button, which adds their profile pic to On Board
* The empty My Calendar prompt remains the same. When users click it, they are directed to registration page, but without the AJAX popup.

For the text that explains what SSO provides, use this:

Going to this event? 
Want to tweet directly from this page?
Find other events your friends on Twitter are interested in?
Click below!

This text should appear in the right side bar, above the Interested button.
